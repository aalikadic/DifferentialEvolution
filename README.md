# DifferentialEvolution
The code in this repository is an example of a working differential evolution algorithm that can be used to optimize functions. It also features graphical representation of the evolutionary process and minimization of the cost function.

The proper functioning of this code is verified with 3 benchmark functions: 1st DeJong Function, 2nd DeJong Function and the Schwefel Function.
